###  It will hold my work for the next 10 labs.

# Lab: 01 - Java primitives and control flow
## This lab is dedicated to practicing Java fundamentals. 

# Feature Tasks:
1- Pluralize:the method pluralize () that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.
### ex : if we call  pluralize("dog", 1) .... the result I own 1 dog


2- Flipping Coins:the method flipNHeads() that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads.
### ex : if we call   flipNHeads(1); .... the result it took 1 flips to flip 1 in a rows



3- Command Line Clock:the method clock () that uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console, second by second. The program should run until someone manually kills it with CTRL-C or presses the “stop” button .
### ex : if we call   clock(); .... the result 18:28:23        18:28:24

# Lab: 02 - Arrays, for loops, testing
## This lab is dedicated to practicing Java Arrays, for loops, testing. 

# Feature Tasks:
1- Rolling Dice:the method roll () that accepts an integer number and rolls a six-sided dice n times. The method should return an array containing the values of the rolls
### ex : if we call  roll(4) .... the result [3, 2, 1, 5]


2- Contains Duplicates:the method containsDuplicat ()  that returns true or false depending on whether the array contains duplicate values.




3- Calculating Averages:the method calculating Averages()  that accepts an array of integers and calculates and returns the average of all the values in the array.

4- Arrays of Arrays:the method arraysOfArrays()calculate the average value for each array and return the array with the lowest average.
