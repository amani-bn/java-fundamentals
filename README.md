# java-fundamentals
###  It will hold my work for the next 10 labs.

# Lab: 01 - Java primitives and control flow
## This lab is dedicated to practicing Java fundamentals. 

# Feature Tasks:
1- Pluralize:the method pluralize () that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.
### ex : if we call  pluralize("dog", 1) .... the result I own 1 dog


2- Flipping Coins:the method flipNHeads() that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads.
### ex : if we call   flipNHeads(1); .... the result it took 1 flips to flip 1 in a rows



3- Command Line Clock:the method clock () that uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console, second by second. The program should run until someone manually kills it with CTRL-C or presses the “stop” button .
### ex : if we call   clock(); .... the result 18:28:23        18:28:24
